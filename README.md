# Frank.XsdCodeGeneration

This might be a dead-end, but I really want to make a code-generator for xsds using the new Roslyn Syntax API. I have tried to do this before, but I have always ended up with a solution that is too complex and too hard to maintain. I want to try again, but this time I want to start with a very simple solution and then build on that.
